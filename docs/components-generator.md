# Components Generator

Use the component generator utility to create scaffoling for a new component.

### Usage

To start the component generator, run the following command:

```shell
$ php craft components/component/generate [componentName]
```
* Optional: `componentName`
  * Must be quoted if `componentName` is multiple words

This will start an interactive process to create a component.

IMPORTANT - Fields need to be created before they can be added to a component. See the [fields](fields-generator.md) section for more information.
